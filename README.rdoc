= ComfortableMexicanLoveseat

The Comfortable Mexican Loveseat is an expansion pack to the Comfortable Mexican Sofa. It currently contains minor modifications to the <tt>snippet.rb</tt> and <tt>base_controller.rb</tt> files, improved sitemap functionality, and SEO-enhancing modifications.

The Loveseat references a fixed version of the CMS (currently 1.12.8) and latest releases are pulled in occasionally.

== Custom Sitemaps

Building on the Sofa's sitemap functionality, the Loveseat lets you add Rails model show pages and custom routes to the sitemap.

To use it, please copy and customize the demo initializer located in <tt>templates/comfortable_mexican_loveseat</tt> and in your <tt>routes.rb</tt> file make sure you have this line:

<tt>comfy_route :cms, :path => '/', :sitemap => true</tt>

Then replace your <tt>robots.txt</tt> file with the one in the templates folder.

== URL Redirection

By default when using the Loveseat, all trailing slash URLs ('myapp.com/example/') are redirected to a non-trailing slash URL.

== SEO Meta Tags

By default when you create an application, it comes with meta description; meta title; no-index; index; and canonical link fields that can be filled in on a per-page basis. To display these tags, add them to your <tt>application.html.erb</tt>:

  <meta name="description" content="<%= cms_block_content(:meta_description) %>"/>
